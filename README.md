## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Looking through the figma file and figuring out what to go where, and still trying to keep it as simple as possible was fun.

It's a very simple project and I'm looking forward to tackling the more complex ones.

### Continued development

Trying to learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox, and how to use them together.
